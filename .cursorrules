## Discord Bot Development

The discord bot is for a school.
The structure of the discord guild is as follows:

ALl promotions have their own channels.
In all promotions, a signature thread can or cannot exist.
the bot can scan the guild to dress a list of all promotion and the state of the signature thread (exist or not)
this bot is a proof of concept, so for the test the bot will scan all user of the guild and threat them both as teacher and student.

## Signature Thread 

The signature thread is a thread that is created in the promotion channel.
The bot must create two messages in the signature thread.
The first is a embed message for students to claim their signature code.
the second is for teachers to remind students sign.

## First message
The message is an embed message with the following fields:
- title: "Signature Code"
- select menu to select the teacher
- button to claim the signature code
- this action send a private message to the teacher with the signature code

## Second message
The message is an embed message with the following fields:
- title: "Signature Code"
- select menu to select one or more students
- button to remind selected students sign
- button to remind all students sign
- this action send a private message to the selected students that tells student to verify their signature
